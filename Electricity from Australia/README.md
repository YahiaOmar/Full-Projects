# ML Algorisms EDA for Electricity from Australia

This project involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and machine learning modeling on a dataset related to electricity consumption in Australia. The goal is to analyze patterns in electricity usage and build predictive models to forecast electricity demand.

## Project Objectives

- **Perform EDA**: Explore and analyze the dataset to understand patterns and trends in electricity consumption.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and preprocess the data for modeling.
- **Build Models**: Develop and evaluate machine learning models to predict electricity usage.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Import and load the electricity consumption dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values, outliers, and data types.
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Conduct statistical analysis and create visualizations to uncover insights.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Generate new features and transform existing ones for better model performance.
5. **Model Building**: Train and evaluate machine learning models for electricity consumption prediction.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning modeling and evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and visualization.
