# Premier League EDA, Regression, and Clustering

## Project Overview

This project explores and analyzes data from the English Premier League, focusing on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), regression analysis, and clustering. The goal is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data, and to build predictive models that can forecast various outcomes related to player and team performance.

## Objective

The main objectives of this project are:
- Perform in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the underlying structure of the data.
- Build and evaluate regression models to predict key outcomes.
- Apply clustering techniques to identify groups of similar players or teams.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data by handling missing values, standardizing formats, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and key statistics using visualizations.
3. **Regression Analysis**: Developing regression models to predict outcomes such as goals scored, assists, and other performance metrics.
4. **Clustering**: Applying clustering algorithms like K-Means to group players or teams based on their performance metrics.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of the regression models using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

## Results

- **EDA**: The EDA revealed significant insights into player and team performance, with visualizations highlighting trends and relationships.
- **Regression**: The regression models provided a good fit for predicting outcomes such as goals and assists, with R-squared values indicating the models' effectiveness.
- **Clustering**: The clustering analysis successfully grouped players and teams into distinct clusters, providing a deeper understanding of performance dynamics in the league.

## Conclusion

This project offers a comprehensive analysis of Premier League data, combining EDA, regression, and clustering to generate valuable insights. The findings can be used by analysts, coaches, and enthusiasts to better understand the factors driving success in the league.
