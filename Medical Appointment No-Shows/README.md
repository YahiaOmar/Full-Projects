## Project Objectives

- **Understand Data Distribution**: Analyze the distribution of no-shows and various features in the dataset.
- **Identify Patterns**: Explore relationships between no-shows and factors such as age, gender, and appointment scheduling.
- **Visualize Insights**: Use visualizations to illustrate key findings and patterns in the data.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Loading**: Import and load the dataset for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, outliers, and data types.
3. **Exploratory Analysis**: Perform statistical analysis and generate visualizations to uncover insights.
4. **Feature Analysis**: Examine the impact of different features on no-show rates.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: The primary programming language used.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive analysis and visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following features:
- `PatientId`: Unique identifier for each patient.
- `AppointmentID`: Unique identifier for each appointment.
- `Gender`: Gender of the patient.
- `ScheduledDay`: The day the appointment was scheduled.
- `AppointmentDay`: The day of the appointment.
- `Age`: Age of the patient.
- `No-show`: Whether the patient showed up or not.
